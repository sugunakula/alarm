in game screen when i press on practice mode it is showing coming soon
in add alarm screen the save button is not visible
and i can't hear the alarm sounds too
add option to add custom sounds also
if i set the alarm and when it is time, it showing only volume control not showing the alarm dismissal screen fix it, actually it must alarm and to snooze to play minigames know, add permission like display over other apps, so even i am using another when it is alarm time it must display it, also if i set alarm and close this app it must alarm at correct time without app running background
